# linear_phased_array
Welcome to the beamforming world!!

This is the project that i did in junior semesters, and finally get the second place in the oral presentation as well as some great image of the object.

## motivation
Phased array technique actually is a old-fashion, finding a lot of application in military and detection of object in self-driving car. In my project we want to use the system to detection respiratory pattern to measure heart rate, which has a lot to do with diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. The system is especially well-suited for continuous monitor for its light and low-cost property. The reason that we need to continuously monitor vital sign is we prefer to avoid symptom becoming worse. And is the system could come in handy.  

# background knowledge
To get a better picture of the system, i highly suggest that you take a look at the following link, they provide many useful courses:

# code description
If you want to know how i control the ultrasound, check phased_array_bit and phased_array_integer.

If you want to know the simulation result, check ultrasound folder. They provide many simulation which is very useful before you construct the system.

If you want to know how i reconstruct the image, check imageforultra in ultrasound folder and draw_ultrasound folder. There are still a lot of space of improvement, though.
